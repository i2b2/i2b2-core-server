/**
 * This exception is thrown when logical connections between data fields would
 * be violated by the imported data.
 * <p>This can be for constraints like making certain a number is in a certain
 * range, or it can even be thrown by code using opencsv when constraints
 * outside of opencsv would be violated. An example of the latter is importing
 * into a database when one of the field in the CSV is supposed to contain the
 * primary key for a foreign table, but the foreign key cannot be satisfied.</p>
 * <p>This exception is not currently used by opencsv itself, since opencsv has
 * no concept of what data consistency means in the context of the application
 * using it. It is meant more for custom converters.</p>
